Re-Carry is a community-driven platform that helps people receive forgotten items while traveling long distances  trains. The app connects individuals who need an item delivered with verified travellers already moving along the same route. Users can post requests, and travellers can accept tasks to pick up and deliver items, earning rewards for their help. ReCarry provides faster, cheaper, and more human-centered delivery compared to traditional couriers. By turning everyday travellers into helpers, the platform promotes trust, cooperation, and convenience—ensuring that essential items reach people on time, no matter where they are.
